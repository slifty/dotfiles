# Email Philosophy

This whole system has become untenable, so it is time to write down some ground rules.

## Subscriptions

When there is an unsubscribe button in an email, rapidly click it unless:

1. You know the sender personally and they will be offended if you unsubscribe.
2. The content is relevant to you AND there is no RSS feed alternative.

## Tagging and Folders

I have no philosophy here yet, but would like to have one some day so I'm including the section.

## Archive vs Delete

* **Delete** emails that will never need reference in future OR the information could be referenced elsewhere.
* **Archive** emails that might need reference in future.

### Scenarios

| Scenario    | Outcome |
| -------- | ------- |
| Order confirmation  | ARCHIVE |
| Shipping update | DELETE |
| Password Reset | DELETE |
| Email from Justin Reese | DELETE WITHOUT READING |
| Political donation email | DELETE AND UNSUBSCRIBE |
| Newsletter | DELETE |
| Listserv email | DELETE IF WEB ARCHIVE EXISTS |
| Watched codebase email | DELETE |
